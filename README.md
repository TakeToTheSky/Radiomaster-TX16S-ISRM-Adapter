Radiomaster TX16S ISRM Adapter

This project was created to allow the Radiomaster TX16S radio transmitter to run the Frsky Access RF protocol.  The ISRM module used is the module available to upgrade the Frsky Horus X10S radio to the Access RF protocol.  I have designed a PCB with the same footprint as the Radiomaster TX16S 4 in 1 multimodule RF board.  This allows the adapter to attach to the existing mounting brackets.
